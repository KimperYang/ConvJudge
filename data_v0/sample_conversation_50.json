Since you mentioned a change, I’ll go ahead and start by looking into your booking, but before that—and so we don’t miss any details—could you share your order number or PNR along with your last name, and if you already know your preferred new date and time window we can bundle that in too so I can search in one shot; also if you have any flexibility on airports or cabin, just mention it now and I’ll factor that in without delay."
