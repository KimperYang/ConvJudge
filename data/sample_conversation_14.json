Since you mentioned a specialist and an existing booking and maybe there are multiple issues like payment or seats or even flight changes, I can help with a lot of that, but let me just jump in and start getting you routed while we talk. Are you asking to be transferred right away, or do you want me to try to fix it first? I can also touch on policies if needed."
