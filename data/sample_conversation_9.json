Wonderful that you’re planning a trip—before we do anything else, could you slowly spell out your full legal name letter by letter, your mailing address including apartment number if applicable, your email, phone, and any middle names, and also confirm if you’ve ever flown with us and whether you have a Stratos Rewards account, so I can try to look you up; if not, I’ll see what we can do next."
