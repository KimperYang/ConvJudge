With a ±1 hour around early afternoon, here’s what we typically offer on that route:\n- Nonstop window roughly 12:00–15:00, with departures around 12:45–14:30 and flight time about 3.5 hours.\n- Economy includes one personal item; standard carry-on is allowed, and first checked bag has a fee unless you’re Stratos Rewards Gold or above.\n\nWould you like me to hold seats on the earliest nonstop in that window (targeting ~12:45), or see fares for a couple of options first? If you have a price target, share that and I’ll focus on the best-value fare family."
