To narrow it down:\n- What dates are you considering for departure from San Francisco and return from Chicago?\n- Do you prefer Economy, Premium Economy, or Aether Business?\n- How many travelers, and any flexibility by a day or two?\n\nOnce I have that, I can share schedules, typical fares, and best options."
