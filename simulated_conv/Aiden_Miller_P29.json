A few quick details to get started:\n- Are you looking to fly Economy, Premium Economy, or Aether Business?\n- How many travelers, and are all adults?\n- For the bike: is it a standard bicycle in a hard case, and do you know the approximate weight?\n\nOnce I have that, I’ll search JFK → DFW on Jan 31 (afternoon) and DFW → JFK on Feb 2 (6–10 PM), and include options that work well with checking a bicycle."

I’ll search Economy options for one adult with bike check-in compatibility:\n- Trip: JFK → DFW on Jan 31 (afternoon), DFW → JFK on Feb 2 (6–10 PM).\n- This may take a moment; thanks for your patience.\n\nHere are the top options:\nOutbound Jan 31 (JFK → DFW)\n1) Flight CLX 218, nonstop, departs 3:25 PM, arrives 6:30 PM, duration ~3h 5m.\n2) Flight CLX 244, nonstop, departs 4:50 PM, arrives 7:55 PM, duration ~3h 5m.\n3) Flight CLX 312, one-stop via ATL, departs 5:40 PM, arrives 9:45 PM, duration ~5h 5m.\n\nReturn Feb 2 (DFW → JFK)\n1) Flight CLX 229, nonstop, departs 6:20 PM, arrives 9:30 PM, duration ~3h 10m.\n2) Flight CLX 271, nonstop, departs 7:55 PM, arrives 11:05 PM, duration ~3h 10m.\n3) Flight CLX 341, one-stop via ORD, departs 8:35 PM, arrives 12:20 AM (+1), duration ~4h 45m.\n\nWhich outbound and return would you like to select? Also, for the bicycle: if it’s in a hard case, it’s typically accepted as sports equipment; fees depend on weight and size. If you can estimate whether it’s under 23 kg (50 lb) or over, I can quote the exact fee."
