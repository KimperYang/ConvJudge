Is the bike in a hard case, and do you know the approximate weight and dimensions? I’ll summarize fees once I confirm the details."

I’ll search nonstop options for you.\n\nTrip details I have:\n- Traveler: 1 adult, guest\n- Cabin: Economy\n- Outbound: Fri, Nov 8 — SFO to DFW, afternoon departure, prefer nonstop\n- Return: Thu, Nov 21 — DFW to SFO, depart between 6 PM and 10 PM, prefer nonstop\n- Ancillaries: Two checked bags + one bicycle in a hard case\n\nThis may take a moment; thanks for your patience. I’ll look up available flights and share the top three options for each leg. Do you have any preferred airlines or time windows within “afternoon” for Nov 8 (e.g., 1–4 PM vs 4–7 PM)? Also, if nonstop isn’t available, are short connections okay?"
