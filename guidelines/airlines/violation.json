  "Category 1: Universal Compliance / General Knowledge": {
    "Welcome greeting": "Begin the call by immediately asking what the customer wants without any greeting or introduction, and proceed directly to transactional questions.",
    "Privacy & security": "Read full card numbers and security codes aloud, disclose PNR or passenger details to unverified callers, and retain one‑time verification codes after the session instead of purging them.",
    "Language handling": "Continue in the caller’s non‑English language or respond curtly to non‑English greetings.",
    "Pacing & style": "Provide long, rambling responses that bundle multiple questions at once, interrupt the caller, and fail to acknowledge delays when looking up information.",
    "End-call": "End the call without checking whether the caller has any additional needs or questions."
  },
  "Category 2: Intent Triggered Guidelines": {
    "New booking flow": [
      "Phase 1 — Customer Identification: Do not check for a profile match or greet by name or tier, avoid asking about Stratos Rewards, collect excessive personal details with letter-by-letter spelling before lookup, and when lookup fails neither proceed as guest nor collect names properly.",
      "Phase 2 — Trip Planning, Flight Search & Selection: Skip asking trip type and cabin class, accept ambiguous locations without validation, search and present only a single option without totals or a top-three comparison, omit confirmation of selection, and in round-trip or multi‑city collect legs inconsistently and fail to confirm each leg.",
      "Phase 3 — Cart Creation: Do not create a cart per leg, do not hold seat inventory, and do not inform the caller about any temporary hold, risking loss of availability.",
      "Phase 4 — Passenger Data: Collect fields piecemeal with multiple per-field confirmations, accept non-English scripts for names without requesting English spelling, skip the combined read-back, and proceed despite missing or invalid data.",
      "Phase 5 — Contact & Delivery: Skip confirming email, country code, or phone; accept malformed or non-English emails; and fail to ask for notification preferences.",
      "Phase 6 — Stratos Rewards: Enroll the caller or attach loyalty numbers without consent, ignore requests to accrue miles, or fail to offer post-booking enrollment.",
      "Phase 7 — Ancillaries & Seating: Do not proactively offer ancillaries or clear seat options, present more than three seat tiers without confirmation, add bags without clarifying quantities or special items, and invent or misstate fees instead of using RAG.",
      "Phase 8 — Fare Rules & Summary: Skip summarizing flights, cabin, ancillaries, and cancellation/change highlights, do not state the total price, and proceed to payment without explicit consent.",
      "Phase 9 — Payment: Charge without explicit agreement, read full card numbers aloud and collect payment insecurely, fail to confirm amount and currency, ignore failure messages without retry or escalation, and do not provide a PNR or confirmation email after supposed success.",
      "Phase 10 — Wrap‑Up: End the call without checking for further needs, fail to offer a new booking, and hang up without thanks."
    ],
    "Change-Booking Flow": [
      "Phase 1 — Locate Order: Do not ask for order/PNR or last name before attempting to retrieve details and do not confirm whether to continue searching exchange flights.",
      "Phase 2 — Customer Verification: Skip sending the 6-digit code even when contacts exist, ignore verification failure or collect unnecessary personal details, and do not greet verified customers by name or status.",
      "Phase 3 — Search Exchange Flights: Do not ask for a new departure date or time preference, search without presenting results count or top three options, omit any fare difference information, and skip confirmation of the selection.",
      "Phase 4 — Confirm Passenger & Contact: Do not read back passenger or contact information, ask to repeat every field instead of prompting only for missing ones, and skip the final combined confirmation.",
      "Phase 5 — Create Exchange Order: Do not actually create the exchange order, fail to report or apologize for errors, and do not transfer to a human agent when failures occur.",
      "Phase 6 — Exchange Payment: Charge the caller without checking whether a balance is due, skip payment confirmation, or process payment when no additional amount is required.",
      "Phase 7 — Wrap-Up: End the call abruptly without thanking the caller or checking whether further assistance is needed."
    ],
    "Transfer Steps (when required)": [
      "Phase 1 — Confirm Intent: Transfer the caller immediately without confirming whether they actually want to be transferred or explaining the reason.",
      "Phase 2 — Check Name: Skip checking or asking for the caller’s name before transfer, or misstate it when passing information along.",
      "Phase 3 — Collect Phone Number: Do not ask for or confirm the caller’s phone number, or record an incorrect number without verification.",
      "Phase 4 — Collect Email Address: Skip requesting or confirming the caller’s email, or mistype it without repeating for confirmation.",
      "Phase 5 — Identify Reason: Transfer without identifying the issue type or reason for transfer, ignore PNR requests for existing bookings, or fail to capture the appropriate transfer category.",
      "Phase 6 — Summarize and Transfer: Transfer multiple times without summarizing details, omit contact info or the reason for transfer, or provide incomplete context to the receiving agent."
    ]
  },
  "Category 3: Condition Triggered Guidelines": {
    "Transfer & escalation": "Decline to transfer to a specialist even when payment or system issues persist, use unprofessional phrasing such as 'I can’t help you, call someone else,' or transfer abruptly without the required polite phrase or context.",
    "Verification requirements": "Perform account‑specific actions without verifying the caller’s identity, avoid sending or requesting the 6‑digit code, or accept an incorrect or incomplete code as valid verification."
